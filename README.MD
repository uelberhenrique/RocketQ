Rocket.Q is a platform for anonymous questions, where you can create a room at any time and share it on your social networks or lives, and people without identifying themselves can ask questions, compliments or suggestions.

Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3 - FlexBox - Grid
* NodeJS
* Express
* EJS

What I learned from this project:

* About how the Browsers User Agent works.
* I learned rem measurements, and techniques for ease of use.
* I actually understood the grid-layout
* I understood a lot about routes
* And I used esl to run html on nodeJS

I thank God for all the learning.
